# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `Assets/` holds all game content and source code.
  - `Assets/Scripts/` contains runtime C# code (e.g., `Assets/Scripts/Input/`).
  - `Assets/Scenes/` stores Unity scenes (`.unity`).
  - `Assets/Settings/` keeps URP and project-specific assets.
  - `Assets/Plugins/` includes third-party packages (e.g., UniTask, Zenject).
- `Packages/` and `ProjectSettings/` define Unity package and editor configuration.
- `Library/`, `Temp/`, and `Logs/` are generated by Unity; don’t edit or commit changes from these.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Unity version: 2022.3.62f2 (see `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`).
- Open the project in Unity Hub and use the Editor for play/build.
- Headless test run example:
  - `Unity -batchmode -projectPath . -runTests -testResults TestResults.xml -quit`
- No custom CLI scripts are defined in this repo; add them in `README` or CI if needed.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow existing C# style in `Assets/Scripts`:
  - 4-space indentation, braces on new lines.
  - `PascalCase` for types and public members, `_camelCase` for private fields.
  - Keep namespaces aligned with folder structure (e.g., `namespace Input`).
- Prefer Unity conventions for MonoBehaviours, ScriptableObjects, and serialized fields.

## Testing Guidelines
- Uses Unity Test Framework (`com.unity.test-framework`).
- Place new tests under `Assets/Tests/` with separate EditMode/PlayMode folders and `.asmdef` files.
- Name tests clearly (e.g., `PlayerInputTests.cs`) and keep them deterministic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit history is short and informal; use concise, imperative messages (e.g., "Add input system").
- PRs should include:
  - A brief summary and testing notes.
  - Linked issue/task if applicable.
  - Screenshots or clips for gameplay/UI/scene changes.

## Configuration Tips
- Package dependencies live in `Packages/manifest.json`.
- Input actions are defined in `Assets/Scripts/Input/NewInputSystem.inputactions`.
